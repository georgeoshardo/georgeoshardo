### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a systems biology PhD student in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.
- I like programming in Python. I started learning it last year during my MPhil in Biotechnology. 
- I'm currently learning Julia and often use MATLAB for some things. 
- I'm interested in numerical simulations of biological systems and image processing of high throughput microscopy data.
